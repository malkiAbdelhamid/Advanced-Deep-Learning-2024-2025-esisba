## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

If you do not have conda package manager then visit this page [Getting Started with conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)

1. Create conda environment, I faced some issues with python 3.11.4

   ```sh
    conda create -n AdvancedDL python=3.10.12
   ```
2. Activate the env

    ```sh
    conda activate AdvancedDL	
    ```

3. Install required packages

   ```sh
   pip install -r lab1_QLearning/requirements_lab1.txt
   ```
